# Text Normalization

Text Normalization is part of NeMo's `nemo_text_processing` - a Python package that is installed with the `nemo_toolkit`. 
It converts text from written form into its verbalized form, e.g. "123" -> "one hundred twenty three".

See [NeMo documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/nemo/user-guide/docs/en/stable/nlp/text_normalization/wfst/wfst_text_normalization.html) for details.
